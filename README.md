# password-manager
A password manager. Final project for AIT Applied Cryptography

Note: May have to change implementation for the "directory" file, as Pickle takes a file object and not a bytes object or String. Perhaps simpler to serialize ourselves.

Big PM guy here, enjoy this text-based SCRUM board!

To do:

Adding an account
Retrieving details
Modifying an account

Change master password
